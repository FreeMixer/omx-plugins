# A CI bridge, to be deleted with its calls once omx-plugins 0.17.0 and omx-panel 0.8.1 are in the OpenMixer channel.
#
# The sheet of the parameter units moved to omx-contract 3.6.0 (OMX_PARAM_CONTRACT_UNITS). The channel's
# omx-plugins-contract before 0.17.0 still installs it as .../contract.d/3/omx-plugins/param-units.json, so beside
# omx-contract 3.6.0 the contract directory declares the item twice and every omx-contract read refuses it
# (contract.item.duplicate). `dnf builddep` pulls that package in (omx-panel requires it). This script, run right after
# builddep:
#   1. drops the file AND its line in the installed MANIFEST.json (the file alone makes the reader refuse the directory
#      with contract.manifest.mismatch, because the manifest still lists it);
#   2. replaces an omx-panel older than 0.8.1 with one built from source. omx-panel 0.8.0 reads its unit codes from that
#      very file and fails without it; 0.8.1 reads omx-contract's sheet. $OMX_PANEL_REF is the omx-panel ref to build
#      (default main, which holds the reader once omx-panel#108 has merged).
# The package this tree builds has neither the file nor the problem, so with 0.17.0 in the channel there is nothing to
# drop and this exits at once. It refuses to run after EXPIRES: by then the channel has both packages, or this is a bug.
