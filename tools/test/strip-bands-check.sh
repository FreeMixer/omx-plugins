# strip-bands-check.sh [<ref>] — omx-strip's band count (`eqBands`, FreeMixer/omx-plugins#308) against the strip
# before it had one, bit for bit, at every rate the contract declares (tools/test/clap-crosscheck.c):
#
#   golden    Bands at its default, every band past it switched on at a boost: today's strip, bit for bit
#             (the bands past the count are not processed, and the first ones are today's).
#   flat      Bands at the maximum, every band past today's on and flat (0 dB): today's strip, bit for bit.
#   boundary  Bands at 8, bands 5 to 8 on and flat, every band past 8 on at a boost: today's strip.
#   reach     Bands at the maximum, every band past today's on at a boost: NOT today's strip (the count
#             reaches them; without this arm the three above could pass with bands that never reach the face).
#   reach5    Bands at 5, band 5 alone on at a boost: NOT today's strip (the count moves one band at a time).
#   sabotage  the golden arm against a strip built to process every band whatever the count: NOT today's
#             strip (the guard of the golden arm, broken on purpose; it must go red).
#   sessions  today's factory presets, as presets and as the sessions today's strip saves from them, loaded
#             into this strip: the same values, the band count at its default, and the same output
#             (tools/test/clap-session-crosscheck.c).
#   sessions-sabotage  the same against a strip built to lose a session's third band: NOT the same (red).
#
# Today's strip is built from <ref>, by default the newest first-parent commit whose declaration has no band count, against
# the omx-dsp installed (the one this tree builds with). Exit 0 when every arm is as stated, 1 when one is not, 2
# when a plugin cannot be built.
