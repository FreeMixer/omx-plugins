#
# The release gate: every CLAP plugin the tree builds gets plugin-qualify's real-time-safety verdict,
# and the release goes ahead only when each one is `suitable`. It builds the tree, installs it into a
# staging directory, runs plugin-qualify over every installed `.clap` and checks the qualification
# records it wrote (`<id>@<version>-<sha256 first 12>.<offer>.qualification.json`, each beside the byte
# copy of the probe output it judged), so the verdicts that gate the release are the ones that ship
# beside it. A record belongs to a plugin by the full SHA-256 of the binary it names.
#
#   - a plugin whose record holds a verdict other than `suitable` (or one not qualified, or not
#     measured) refuses the release, named with its verdict;
#   - an installed `.clap` with no record refuses it too (a prober that wrote nothing is not a pass);
#   - a record of a schema this gate does not know, or whose probe output copy is missing or is not
#     the bytes the record names, refuses it;
#   - plugin-qualify's own exit code (1 some unqualified, 2 not measurable) refuses it.
#
# Needs the channel packages: plugin-qualify >= 0.11.0 (the first to write qualification records),
# omx-clap-host (`omx-clap-scan`) and the build dependencies of packaging/omx-plugins.spec. `make` is
# skipped when QUALIFY_STAGE names a prefix that already holds a build.
# Exit: 0 every plugin suitable, 1 refused, 2 the gate could not run.
#
#   tools/qualify-release.sh --self-test   a stand-in prober over a two-plugin stage: a pass passes, and
#                                          an unsuitable verdict, a missing record, a `suitable` rating
#                                          that is not qualified, an unknown schema, a missing or altered
