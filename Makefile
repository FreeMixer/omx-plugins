#   make lv2-units  every unit a declaration uses has an LV2 unit, and every port states the unit it declares
#                   (tools/test/lv2-units-check.mjs, with its sabotage arms; part of `make test`)
#   make lv2-maintainer  every generated TTL gives its doap:maintainer a foaf:homepage (tools/test/lv2-maintainer-check.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make lv2-manifest  every manifest lists <modgui.ttl> where omx-panel's reader finds it (tools/test/lv2-manifest-check.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make format-tables  the generators read plugin-hostd's installed format tables backwards (tools/format-tables.mjs):
#                   the units, the 169 lv2:designation lines and the ratio unit, the CLAP modules from the descriptors'
#                   groups (tools/test/format-tables-test.mjs, with its sabotage arms; part of `make test`)
#   make round-trip  every described plugin generated, both faces built and scanned back by plugin-hostd-probe describe,

#                   (tools/round-trip.{sh,mjs}, with its two sabotage arms; part of `make test`)

#   make face-ids   the host's bypass and LV2 enabled and latency sit at omx-contract's permanent ids (OMX_PLUGIN_FACE_IDS), none
#                   moved by an appended parameter (tools/test/face-ids-test.mjs, with its self-test; part of `make test`)
#   make probe-checks  clap-params-check, panel-check, clap-ext-check and port-groups-check each fail on a built face that is wrong,

#   make param-tie   every by-reference parameter's symbol is its control's words or says its `control`: swapped refs are refused
#                   (FreeMixer/omx-plugins#58; tools/test/param-tie-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make summary-numbers  a plugin summary reads its numbers from the declaration: none types a limit or default of its parameters,
#                   and a moved contract moves the catalogue row (FreeMixer/omx-plugins#174; tools/test/summary-numbers-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make phaser-depth  omx-phaser's generated panel publishes its depth role on depthOct, in octaves (FreeMixer/omx-plugins#232;
#                   tools/test/phaser-depth-role-test.mjs and its --self-test; part of `make test`)
#   make strip-visible-when  omx-strip's panel follows its band count: at eqBands 4 bands 1..4 are shown and 5..32
#                   hidden, and no page holds a hidden band (tools/test/strip-visible-when-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make strip-pages-follow  omx-strip's CLAP remote-control pages follow Bands: 4, 32, 9 and 4 bands read back through the
#                   extension from the built face, the host told by changed() (tools/test/strip-pages-follow-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make band-groups  omx-eq8's generated descriptor and TTL hold one LV2 port group per band, Band 1 ... Band 8 in band
#                   order, each its five controls (tools/test/eq8-band-groups-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make geq-widgets  omx-geq declares the fader for its 31 bands, and its panel description and generated header serve them
#                   (tools/test/geq-widgets-test.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make hints      no LV2 face lost a port hint: tools/port-hints.mjs against each declaration's `portHints` pin
#   make modgui     every plugin's MOD GUI is what omx-panel writes from its descriptor and its declared panel: each plugin's
#                   `make check` (the generated-fresh step of CI runs it beside `node tools/gen.mjs --check`)
#   make manual     each declaration's manual follows omx-contract: a travel moved in a copy of the release moves
#                   the catalogue section's range and default (tools/test/manual-perturb.mjs)
#   make params-doc  write docs/plugins/: one page of every parameter for each plugin and the index (tools/params-doc.mjs, from the declarations)
#   make check-params-doc  the committed pages are what the declarations generate, and say what the generated TTLs say (tools/test/params-doc-test.mjs); run by CI beside `node tools/gen.mjs --check`
#   make panel-copies  no tracked file is a film strip or a fixture omx-panel renders or ships: `omx-panel copies`
#                      over the tree, with its --self-test; run by CI beside `make test`
#   make private-refs  no tracked file (generated ones included) points into a private repository, issue, branch or path
#                      (tools/private-refs-check.sh, with its --self-test); run by CI beside `make test`
#   make recipe-test   the repository's own checks, run by CI beside `make test`:
#     make completeness  every plugin against recipes/plugin.recipe.json, each gap naming its wizard step;
#                        a gap not in recipes/completeness-debt.json fails, and so does a paid debt entry
#     make selftest      the recipe's checkers, wizard and commit protocol, each sabotaged (needs git)
#   make meters-abi  the clap.meters/1 header omx-clap-core installs has the id, enums, sizeof and offsetof the
#                    plugins are built for (tools/test/meters-abi-test.c, compile and run; part of `make test`)
#   make param-contract-abi  include/omx_param_contract.h's extension table and entry are the layout omx-clap-core's
#                    omx_clap_ext.h reads (tools/test/param-contract-abi-test.c, compile and run; part of `make test`)
#   make strip-crosscheck   omx-strip, a chain, against the hand-ported strip it replaced, bit for bit at
#                    the old plugin's settings (tools/test/strip-crosscheck.sh; needs the git history, and builds the
#                    omx-contract and omx-dsp releases the old commit pinned, from sibling checkouts' tags or GitHub).
#                    Known gap: the low-pass above 0.6 of Nyquist at 44.1 and 48 kHz is not compared (omx-dsp's hand-over,
#                    omx-dsp#105/#116/#119, removed a passband lift the hand-ported strip had); the map's @cap line says so
#   make strip-bands  omx-strip's band count (#308) against the strip before it had one, bit for bit at every declared
#                   rate: at its default count with every band past it boosted, and with the extra bands flat, it is
#                   that strip; with the count reaching a boosted band it is not; built to process every band
#                   whatever the count it is not (the sabotage); and that strip's factory presets, as presets and as the
#                   sessions it saves, load into this one with the same values and output (tools/test/strip-bands-check.sh,
#                   tools/test/clap-session-crosscheck.c; needs the git history; part of `make test`)
#   make strip-bands-bench  omx-strip's CPU cost by band count (4, 8, 16, 32, and its EQ off) through the built CLAP
#                   face, at BENCH_RATES (default 48000 96000): microseconds per 128-frame block and the share of a core
#                   (tools/test/strip-bands-bench.c; a figure for one machine, not part of `make test`)
#   make presets    the factory presets: fresh against tools/gen-presets.mjs, each value inside its declared travel (part of `make test`)
#   make presets-figures  the measured figures of the console's two catalogue presets, through omx-dsp's instance faces: the
#                   amp-input bell (+4.00 dB at 2.5 kHz), the amp-tube harmonics (H2/H3 on the closed form), the dimension's
#                   L - R null; each sabotaged by --self-test (tools/test/preset-figures.mjs; part of `make test` and `make test-faces`)
#   make install    DESTDIR, PREFIX, LIBDIR, CLAPDIR, DATADIR: $(CLAPDIR)/<name>.clap, $(LIBDIR)/lv2/<name>.lv2/ and the
#                   factory presets in $(DATADIR)/omx/presets/<plugin id>/<preset id>.json, then install-pins

#   make contract-dir  the installed tree carries one descriptor per shipped plugin that has one, byte for byte, and
#                   omx-contract's reader reads it (tools/test/contract-dir-check.sh, with its sabotage arms; part of `make test`)
#   make lib        build/lib/libomxplugins.a: every shipped plugin's CLAP face and the table of their
#                   entries (include/omx_clap_static.h), for a host that runs them in-process
#   make lib-test   a C host linked against the archive opens every face through the table, then
#                   again through the installed omxplugins.pc (part of `make test`)
#   make install-devel   the public headers other projects include: $(INCLUDEDIR)/omx-plugins/*.h,
#                   and $(LIBDIR)/libomxplugins.a with $(LIBDIR)/pkgconfig/omxplugins.pc
#   make clap-validate  clap-validator on every built .clap (tools/clap-validate.sh): one JSON report each in build/clap-validator;
#                   CI runs it and reports a failure without failing the job until every plugin passes
#   make release-version  every generated header, descriptor and LV2 plugin file carries VERSION, with its sabotage arms
#                   (tools/test/release-version-check.mjs; part of `make test`)
#   make version    the release version, the one packaging/omx-plugins.spec and debian/changelog carry

#   make test-role  a test plugin (`"role": "test"`) is linked into the archive and `make install` never
